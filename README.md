# IPL Win Probaility Predictor


Cricket live apps like "ESPNcricinfo" ,"Cricbuzz" shows the win probability of the match using Machine Learning.
This web application uses the same type of analysis to make predictions based on the current flow of match in second innings.

## OverView
 
 - []( ) The model has been trained based on 756 matches played from the start of the ipl.
 - []( ) It has records over 1,56,826 balls played.
 - []( ) logestic regression is giving 0.8 percentage accuracy while random forest giving 0.95.even though random forest is giving high accuracy ,as we took out put in the form of probability, logistic regression gives reasonable percentage.
 - []( ) streamlit gives easiest built-in functions for making interfaces with python. 

#### deployment 
I deployed this application using heroku. 
1. A procfile which contains the statements for streamlit to run
2. A requirements.txt file which contains required packages on the server
3. Setup.sh file which contains comands to interact with server.
Needed for deployment.
